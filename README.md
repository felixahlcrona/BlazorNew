Following projects are just for fun, usually done late weekends with a few beers. Code quality 404

## Subtitlefinder
> Subtitlefinder, Crawls subscene and finds the most likely subtitle by using Levenshtein distance algorithm on the collected data. 
There is plugins in VLC to do this but sometimes you get a mismatch between subtitle version and movie. 
This tries to find the exact subtitle so you get pefect sync.

## Avanza Trading sentiment
> Crawls Avanza every 3 minute intraday to get trading sentiment to see if traders are long or short
Avanza publish number of people owning a trading instrument. 
If you trade certificates or futures you buy an underlying asset like a index for example.
These can be traded on short or long basis.
Matching the current bear/bull(short/long) traders with the current market price there could be a possibility to see where the market is heading.
